   protests and mobs used to blackmail and coerce the government into agreeing to their demands.

  <h2>Early Life of Khadim Hussain Rizvi</h2>
  <p>
      Khadim Hussain Rizvi was born in 1966, into a Punjabi Awan family in Pindi Gheb, Attock District, Punjab. His brother, Ameer Hussain, is a retired Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) 
      from Pakistan Army.He started hafiz class in Jhelum. Further, he took admission in Jamia Nizamia Rizvia, Lahore.He is a Hafiz-e-Quran and Sheikh-ul-Hadith.user-generated source?
       He delivered Friday sermons at Lahore's Pir Makki Masjid while in the Punjab Auqaf and Religious Affairs Department.
        He has been a wheelchair user since 2009 ever since an accident near Gujranwala as the driver of his vehicle fell asleep while driving from Rawalpindi to Lahore.
      In 2017, he founded a political party called Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a political front for Tehreek Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLYP). TLP came into existence after
       the hanging of Mumtaz Qadri, who assassinated Salmaan Taseer, the Governor of Punjab, for opposing the blasphemy laws and subsequently rose to fame.
       During the assassination of the Governor, Rizvi was serving as an auqaf official in the Punjab government. Rizvi had justified the assassination on the pretext
        that Taseer had termed the blasphemy law as a "black law". He was served warning notices to cease and desist from spreading his views in favour of blasphemy laws
         but his refusal to do so led to his removal from public service.
      After his removal, Rizvi had more opportunity to preach his views. He travelled across the country to build support for Section 295-C of the Pakistan Penal Code, which deals with 
      blasphemy committed against Muhammad. He also spoke out for the release of Mumtaz Qadri; his persistent advocacy earned him the nickname of "blasphemy activist" in religious circles.
      Rizvi was criticized for being preoccupied with blasphemy accusations while ignoring alleged sexual abuse in Pakistani madrassas. </p>
